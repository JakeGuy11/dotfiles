### My Arch i3 dotfiles
This is just a place I can put all my config files for Arch with i3wm in case I want to share it or apply the same to a clean install\
For the purposes of keeping everything organized, I'll rename the files to what they are, and include their required names and paths commented in the first line of each file\
I plan on adding my complete dotfiles in the future, these files are just temporary while I figure some stuff out
